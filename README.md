# Cursed goto calculator
I recently thought of doing something insanely cursed in C.
Here it is, in all it's horrible glory.
Something that has absolutely no reason to use goto statements using goto statements for almost every flow control, from loops to functions.  
  
Needless to say, ***Please*** do not use this code in an actual production environment
